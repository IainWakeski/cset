I think that the pace of the class is just a little  bit to fast for me, this is because I am more used to classes where we don't move onto a different topic until everybody has a firm grasp on the topic. However I won't let this stop me from learning, I will just have to put in more work on my own inorder to make sure that I have a firm grasp on the topics we discuss in class.

Functions are useful for organizing larger pieces of code because they provide a way for the code to recall that function and than use it later in the code. This can help because you may want to reuse a function later in the code after you already used it. Another reason that this is useful is because if you write a function you can have it do something that normally you wouldn't be able to do while coding, an example of this is wrighting a function that tells you weather a number is even or odd.

Looking at a zoo in trems of scope the zoo keepers are on a global scale, where as the animals are only a local scope. this can be translated into code by lookin at code in trems of gloabal and local scope. An example of a local scope line of code is `let x = 20;` this local scope as long as it comes before something like an if statment, for example,
```
let x = 20;
if(x < 50){
  console.log(true);
}
```
A global scope is something that can be called upon anytime from anywhere in the code. Anything that follows  someting like `const` would be in the global scope.
