Having completed the first course of the class I would rate myself a still fairly low in terms of what I know and what I can still learn. I say this because I haven't really put in as much effort as I could, and I will definitely be working to fix this issue, because the only way to become successful is to give everything you can. I can't say there is anything different that I would like to do before starting the next course, other than changing the amount to effort that I put into the class.

One of the biggest differences between objects and arrays is that arrays usally only have strings or numbers in side of them, for example the first one used in the Weresquirrel was `let listOfNumbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11];`. This is a simple array but it is used to hold a sequence of numbers. Something that an object can do that an array can't is, objects can take expressions and turn them into something that makes sense. A good example of an object from the Weresquirrel program is as follows.
```
let day1 = {
  Squirrel  = false;
  events: ["work", "touched tree", "pizza", "running"]
 };
 ```
 This shows how an object can not only hold a boolean but also an array.

I think the author choose to use more objects than arrays because with an object you can house an array and use that inorder to accomplish the samething as just using an array. However there are some cases where an array would be better for example, if you just want to srote a list of numbers to be called on latter you would more likely use an array.
I could have used these same expressions in my chose your own adventure to have a system of time with in the game. This could have worked as to where the player would only have a certen amount of time to choose what they wanted to do.
