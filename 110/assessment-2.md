Out of all the CSS properties that I know I can't say that I have a favorite. This is because they are useful in there own ways, for example the padding property allows you to add space between paragraphs and block elements. The way you control how much space is added, is by changing the way you input values, you can change the value around all four sides of a block. The values can contain values sush as `padding: 20px` which would apply padding to all four sides, `padding: 10px 20px` this would apply 10 pixels of padding to the top and bottom and 20 to the left and right.

If you wanted to change the way a menu looked using CSS you could use the `:nth-of-type()` selector inorder to tell people if an item on the menue is spicy, gluten-free, or vegetarian. This would work by taking every nth item on the menu and marking in a different way than the rest. This would be used with an htlm element such as a list item.

The difference between the syntax rules cascade, inherentance, and specificity is that cascade will go from top down to the bottom reading the styles as it goes. Inherentance will only read properties that are set by the parent of the object. Lastly specificity is used for selecting type selectors, class selectors and ID selectors.
