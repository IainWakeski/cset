	<h3><em>Education.</em></h3>
	<p>I am currently enrolled at <em>Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology</em>, studying for a degree in computer software engineering.</p> <p>I went to South Western High School, where I took a class to learn some basics of programming. I was also a part of the schools marching band, I was the leader of a writers club, and I also helped with making the yearbook.</p> 
	<h3><em>Work experience.</em></h3>
	<h4>Arby's (January 2017 - March 2019)</h4>
	<p>I was a crew member at Arby's for two years. In this time I did a bit of everything from taking orders to washing dishes. I chose to leave after a conflict with how they where scheduling me and not checking at my availability.</p>
	<h4>Burbon Bar And Grill (June 2019 - December 2019)</h4>
	<p>I was a line cook at the Burbon Bar and Grill where I cooked food, did food preperation, and occasionally washed dishes. I mostly took on this job as a way to pay for my books and other supplies before starting college.</p>
