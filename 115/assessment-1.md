After spending some time working on larger projects the past few weeks I think that I will adapt to the professional world fairly well. I say this because even with all the time I was given I still put off working on the projects till later in the day, where I could have worked on them as soon as I found out about the project. One that I will be working on is changing my attitude on how I view my work load, meaning that I'll start working on projects when I first hear about them.

When making a choose-your-own-adventure online I would have a description of the room stored inside of a paragraph element with an id for the room it's describing, than using javascript I would call that id and display it for the user.

Different data structures are useful because without them there would be no real way to tell what the flow of the work is. This is because without a diagram to show the work flow of what is interacting with what and where changes where made, people can only guess what the changes are or where things changed. The way it's structured doesn't have to necessarily need to be a tree, it could also work as a timeline. This would work in a way that you could see what was changed and when in a project based on where certain points lie on the timeline.
