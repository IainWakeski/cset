I am most looking forward to learning more about the professional workflow. What I mean by this is that I want to learn how professionals go about starting their projects and than how they go about finishing them.

The way bubbling works is it takes a nested element and allows it to take the focus off of the main element in the section and instead focus on the nested element. an example of this looks like this.
```
<div onclick="alert('div clicked')">Click me
  <p onclick="alert('Paragraph clicked')">Click me</p>
</div>
```
In this example if you would click on a paragraph would alert the user that a paragraph was clicked and than it would tell the user that the div was clicked.
